# Swagger documentation

Swagger documentation is automatically generated *(If enableSwagger is enabled in configuration)* for all endpoints and can be viewed by pointing a browser at the server URL/docs. If you use the quick start script this will be http://localhost:8080/docs. The swagger docs provide quick access to testing your endpoints along with model schema descriptions and query options.
