# Soft Delete

Crudsify supports soft delete functionality for records. When the [**modelOptions.paranoid**](./configuration#modeloptions) property is set to **true**, records will gain an **deletedAt** property when they are created that will be set to **null**. Whenever that record is deleted (via a Crudsify endpoint or method), the record will remain in the table, its **deletedAt** property will be set to **deleted timestamp**, and the **deletedAt** and **deletedBy** properties (if enabled) will be populated.

"Hard" deletion is still possible when soft delete is enabled. In order to hard delete a record (i.e. remove a record from it's table) via the api, a payload must be sent with the **hardDelete** property set to true.

The Crudsify delete methods include a hardDelete parameter in a body request. The following is an example of a hard delete using a [Crudsify handler](./handlers):

```js
//To remove one record
deleteHandler(model, {
  params: {
    id: 1,
  },
  body: {
    hardDelete: true,
  },
});

// To remove multiple records
deleteHandler(model, {
  body: {
    data: [1, 2],
    hardDelete: true,
  },
});
```
