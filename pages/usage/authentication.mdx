# Authentication

## Route authentication
Authentication for generated endpoints is configured through **authentication** property in **config/index.js**. If this property is set to true, then the supplied auth strategy is applied to all generated endpoints by default. For a working example of authentication with Crudsify, see the Quick start.

You can disable authentication for generated CRUD endpoints by setting the correct property to **false** within the **routeOptions** object. Below is a list of properties and the endpoints they affect:

|**Property**|**Affected endpoints when false**|
| :- | :- |
|readAuth|GET /path and GET /path/\{id\} endpoints|
|createAuth|POST /path endpoint|
|updateAuth|PUT /path/\{id\} endpoint|
|deleteAuth|DELETE /path and DELETE /path/\{id\} endpoints|

Similarly, you can disable authentication for generated association endpoints through the following properties within each association object:

|**Property**|**Affected endpoints when false**|
| :- | :- |
|addAuth|POST /owner/\{ownerId\}/child and PUT /owner/\{ownerId\}/child/\{childId\} endpoints|
|removeAuth|DELETE /owner/\{ownerId\}/child and DELETE /owner/\{ownerId\}/child/\{childId\} endpoints|
|readAuth|GET /owner/\{ownerId\}/child endpoint|

For example, a routeOption object that disables authentication for creating objects and removing a specific association could look like this:

```js
routeOptions: {
    createAuth: false,
    users: {
        removeAuth: false
    }
}
```
