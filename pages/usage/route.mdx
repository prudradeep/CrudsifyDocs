# Route customizaion

## Custom path names

By default route paths are constructed using model names, however aliases can be provided to customize the route paths.
**routeOptions.alias** can be set to alter the base path name, and an **alias** property for an association can be set to alter the association path name.

### Example

```js filename="models/user.js"
user.routeOptions = {
  alias: "person",
  role: {
    group: "category",
  },
};
```

will result in the following endpoints:

```
GET /person
GET /person/{id}
POST /person
PUT /person/{id}
DELETE /person/{id}
DELETE /person
GET /person/{ownerId}/category
POST /person/{ownerId}/category
PUT /person/{ownerId}/category/{childId}
DELETE /person/{ownerId}/category
DELETE /person/{ownerId}/category/{childId}
```

## Ommiting routes

You can prevent CRUD endpoints from generating by setting the correct property to **false** within the **routeOptions** object. Below is a list of properties and their effect:

| **Property** | **Effect when false**  |
| :- | :- |
| allowList | Omits GET /path endpoint |
| allowRead | Omits GET /path and GET /path/\{id\} endpoints |
| allowCreate | Omits POST /path endpoint |
| allowUpdate | Omits PUT /path/\{id\} endpoint |
| allowDelete | Omits DELETE /path endpoints and DELETE /path/\{id\} endpoints |
| allowDeleteMany | Omits DELETE /path endpoints |

Similarly, you can prevent association endpoints from generating through the following properties within each association object:

| **Property** | **Effect when false**  |
| - | :- |
|allowAdd | omits POST /owner/\{ownerId\}/child and PUT /owner/\{ownerId\}/child/\{childId\} endpoints |
|allowRemove | omits DELETE /owner/\{ownerId\}/child endpoints and DELETE /owner/\{ownerId\}/child/\{childId\} endpoints |
|allowRemoveMany | omits DELETE /owner/\{ownerId\}/child endpoints |
|allowRead | omits GET /owner/\{ownerId\}/child endpoint |

For example, a routeOption object that omits endpoints for creating objects and removing a association could look like this:

```js filename="models/user.js"
user.routeOptions = {
    allowCreate: false,
    group: {
        allowRemove: false
    }
}
```
