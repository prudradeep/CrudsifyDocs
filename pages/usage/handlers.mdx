# Handlers

Crudsify provides some handlers for the user to take advantage of in their server code. These methods provide several advantages including:

- [Hooks](./hooks) functionality
- [Soft delete](./softdelete) support
- Crudsify [query](./querying) support

The available methods are:

- listHandler
- findHandler
- createHandler
- updateHandler
- deleteHandler
- associationAddOneHandler
- associationRemoveOneHandler
- associationAddManyHandler
- associationRemoveManyHandler
- associationGetAllHandler

These methods provide a quick and easy way to start adding rich, relational data to your db.

 */
deleteHandler(model, req){...}

```

## associationAddOneHandler

```js
/**
 * **Params:**

 */
associationAddManyHandler(model, association, req){...}

```

## associationRemoveManyHandler

```js
/**
 * **Params:**
