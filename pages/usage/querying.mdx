# Querying

Query parameters can be added to GET requests to filter responses. These parameters are structured and function similar to mongoose queries. Below is a list of currently supported parameters:

### $skip
The number of records to skip in the database. This is typically used in pagination.

### $page
The number of records to skip based on the $limit parameter. This is typically used in pagination.

### $limit
The maximum number of records to return. This is typically used in pagination.

### $select
A list of basic fields to be included in each resource.

### $sort
A set of fields to sort by. Including field name indicates it should be sorted ascending, while prepending '-' indicates descending. The default sort direction is 'ascending' (lowest value to highest value). Listing multiple fields prioritizes the sort starting with the first field listed.

### $exclude
A list of Ids to exclude in the result.

### $embed
A set of associations to populate.

### $count
If set to true, only a count of the query results will be returned.

## Pagination
For any GET query that returns multiple documents, pagination data is returned alongside the documents. The response object has the form:

* docs - an array of documents.
* pages - an object where:
    * current - a number indicating the current page.
    * prev - a number indicating the previous page.
    * hasPrev - a boolean indicating if there is a previous page.
    * next - a number indicating the next page.
    * hasNext - a boolean indicating if there is a next page.
    * total - a number indicating the total number of pages.
* items - an object where:
    * limit - a number indicating the how many results should be returned.
    * begin - a number indicating what item number the results begin with.
    * end - a number indicating what item number the results end with.
    * total - a number indicating the total number of matching results.

## Populate nested associations
Associations can be populated through the **$embed** parameter. To populate nested associations, simply chain a parameter with **.**. For example, consider the MANY_MANY group-user association. If we populate the users of a group with /group?$embed=user we might get a response like so:

```json
{
    "id": "1",
    "name": "A-team",
    "users": [
      {
        "user": {
          "id": "1",
          "email": "user@crudsify.com",
          "role": "1"
        },
        "id": "1"
      },
      {
        "user": {
          "id": "2",
          "email": "user2@crudsify.com",
          "role": "2"
        },
        "id": "2"
      }
    ]
}
```

However we can further populate each user's **title** field with a nested **$embed** parameter: **/group?$embed=user.role** which could result in the following response:

```json
{
    "id": "1",
    "name": "A-team",
    "users": [
      {
        "user": {
          "id": "1",
          "email": "user@crudsify.com",
          "role": {
            "id": "1",
            "name": "Admin"
          }
        },
        "id": "1"
      },
      {
        "user": {
          "id": "2",
          "email": "user2@crudsify.com",
          "role": {
            "id": "2",
            "name": "SuperAdmin"
          }
        },
        "id": "2"
      }
    ]
}
```
