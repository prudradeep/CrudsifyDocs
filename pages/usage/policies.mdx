# Policies

Policies are a wrapper methods around ExpressJS middleware, that returns ExpressJS middleware. It provide a powerful method of applying the same business logic to multiple models declaratively.

If [**enablePolicies**](./configuration#enablepolicies) enabled in configuration, policies will be applied to the respective model routes before or after [handlers](./handlers).

You can add an array of policies for the following actions in **pre** or **post** object of a **model.policies**.

- root: Run for all endpoints.
- create: Run only for create endpoint.
- read: Run only for read & list endpoints.
- update: RUn only for update endpoint.
- delete: Run only for remove endpoints.
- associate: Run for all association endpoints.

For example:

```js filename="models/user.js"
//...
user.policies = {
  pre: {
    update: [
      rankAuth(sequelize, configStore.get("/dbPrimaryKey").name),
      promoteAuth(sequelize),
    ],
    delete: [rankAuth(sequelize, configStore.get("/dbPrimaryKey").name)],
    associate: [
      rankAuth(sequelize, "ownerId"),
      permissionAuth(sequelize, false),
      groupAuth(sequelize, false),
    ],
  },
};
//...
```
