# Metadata

## Timestamps

Crudsify supports the following optional timestamp metadata for records:

- createdAt (default enabled)
- updatedAt (default enabled)
- deletedAt (default enabled) (see [Soft delete](./softdelete))
  When [**modelOptions.timestamps**](./configuration#modeloptions) is enabled, these properties will automatically be populated during CRUD operations. For example, say I create a group with a payload of:

  ```json
  {
    "name": "Group",
    "description": "Group description"
  }
  ```

  If I then query for this record I might get:

  ```json
  [
    {
      "id": 4,
      "name": "Group",
      "description": "Group description"
      "createdAt": "2024-03-20T19:27:47.000Z",
    }
  ]
  ```

  If I later update that group's description then an additional query might return:

  ```json
  {
    "id": 4,
    "name": "Group",
    "description": "Updated",
    "createdAt": "2024-03-20T19:27:47.000Z",
    "updatedAt": "2024-03-20T19:32:30.000Z"
  }
  ```

  The **deletedAt** property marks when a record was soft deleted.

### Custom names

You can give custom names to the timestamps metadata by setting following properties of [**modelOptions**](./configuration#modeloptions) in configuration:

- createdAt
- updatedAt
- deletedAt

## User tags

In addition to timestamps, the following user tag metadata can be added to a record:

- createdBy (default disabled, activated via [enableCreatedBy](./configuration#enablecreatedby) property in configuration)
- updatedBy (default disabled, activated via [enableUpdatedBy](./configuration#enableupdatedby) property in configuration)
- deletedBy (default disabled, activated via [enableDeletedBy](./configuration#enabledeletedby) property in configuration) (see [Soft delete](./softdelete))
- If enabled, these properties will record the id of the user performing the corresponding action.

This assumes that your authentication credentials (req.auth.credentials) will contain either a **user** object with a [**dbPrimaryKey**](./configuration#dbprimarykey) property.

> **NOTE**: Unlike timestamp metadata, user tag properties are only set/updated if the record is created/modified using Crudsify endpoints, (not [Crudsify handlers](./handlers)).
